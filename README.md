FL Studio Transcriptions
========================

A simple repository to store and perform versioning on my FL Studio transcriptions of some musics to have a better understanding of how they are made.

All these transcriptions use the Genesis soundfont that is included in the *SoundFonts* directory. 
I don't know how to use relative path to the soundfont so to be able to play the music with the proper instruments, you need to add the *SoundFonts* folder to the settings. To do that, press F10, go to the **File** tab and add the absolute path of the *SoundFonts* directory to the list of extra search folders.
